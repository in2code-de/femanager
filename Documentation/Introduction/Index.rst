.. _what:

What does it do?
----------------

Femanager is an extension for a TYPO3 Frontend-User Registration.
Maybe you know sr_feuser_register but you want to use a more modern extension, give femanager a try.

This extension basicly brings an easy-to-use frontend-user-registration with a profile manager to your system.
In addition femanager was developed to be very flexible and to bring a lot of features out of the box.

Note: Login and a *I forgot my password* function is part of the core and not part of femanager.
