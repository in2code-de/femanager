Using SignalSlots (Hook pendant) to extend femanager
----------------------------------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

SignalSlots (former Hooks) are the possibility for other developer to extend the runtime of a femanager process with their own code.

As an example let's build an extension which sends username and email address of a new registered user to a defined email address.

Note: this is a little bit useless because there is already a setting in flexform to inform administrators and there is a setting in TypoScript to POST values to a third-party-software, but let's use this case for an example.

Use a SignalSlot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Introduction
""""""""""""

As described before, we want to send an email to a defined address every time when a new user is registered.

Creating an extension
"""""""""""""""""""""

femanagersignalslot/ext_emconf.php:

This file is important to install your new extension – write something like:

.. code-block:: php

	<?php

	$EM_CONF[$_EXTKEY] = array(
			'title' => 'femanagersignalslot',
			'description' => 'signalslotexample for femanager',
			'state' => 'alpha',
			'version' => '0.0.1',
			'constraints' => array(
					'depends' => array(
							'extbase' => '6.0.0-6.1.99',
							'fluid' => '6.0.0-6.1.99',
							'typo3' => '6.0.0-6.1.99',
							'femanager' => '1.0.0-1.0.99',
					),
					'conflicts' => array(
					),
					'suggests' => array(
					),
			),
	);

file:`femanagersignalslot/ext_localconf.php`:

This is an example how to use a signal from femanager – in this case we decided to use the signal “createActionBeforePersist” in class “In2codeFemanagerControllerNewController” and want to call a slot in class “In2codeFemanagersignalslotDomainServiceSendMailService” with methodname “send()”

.. code-block:: php

	<?php

	$signalSlotDispatcher = \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\GeneralUtility::makeInstance('TYPO3\\CMS\\Extbase\\SignalSlot\\Dispatcher');
	$signalSlotDispatcher->connect(
		'In2code\Femanager\Controller\NewController',
		'createActionBeforePersist',
		'In2code\Femanagersignalslot\Domain\Service\SendMailService',
		'send',
		FALSE
	);

femanagersignalslot/Classes/Domain/Service/SendMailService.php:

This is our main class which is called every time a new registration process was initiated.

.. code-block:: php

	<?php
	namespace In2code\Femanagersignalslot\Domain\Service;

	class SendMailService
	{

		/**
		 * Send mail about user information
		 *
		 * @param \In2code\Femanager\Domain\Model\User $user
		 * @param \In2code\Femanager\Controller\NewController $pObj
		 * @return void
		 */
		public function send($user, $pObj)
		{
			$message = '
				New user registered
				Username: ' . $user->getUsername() . '
				Email: ' . $user->getEmail() . '
			';
			mail('your@email.com', 'SignalSlot Test', $message);
		}
	}
